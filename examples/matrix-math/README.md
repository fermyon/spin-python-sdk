# Example: `matrix-math`

This is an example of how to use [componentize-py] to build an HTTP app that
does matrix multiplication using [NumPy].  This demonstrates using a non-trivial
Python package containing native extensions within a guest component.

[componentize-py]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py
[NumPy]: https://numpy.org

## Prerequisites

* A clone of the Git repo in which you found this example
* `spin` 2.2 or later
    * As of this writing Spin 2.2 has not yet been released, so we must use the `main` branch of Spin for the time being. You can find pre-built binaries [here](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/releases/tag/canary).
* `componentize-py` 0.11.0
* `NumPy`, built for WASI

Note that we use an unofficial build of NumPy since the upstream project does
not yet publish WASI builds.

```
curl -OL https://github.com/dicej/wasi-wheels/releases/download/v0.0.1/numpy-wasi.tar.gz
tar xf numpy-wasi.tar.gz
```

## Running the example

```
spin build -u
```

Then, in another terminal, send a request to the app:

```
curl -i -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '[[[1,2],[4,5],[6,7]], [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]]' \
    http://127.0.0.1:3000/multiply
```

The output of that command should be something like:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
transfer-encoding: chunked
date: Fri, 19 Jan 2024 22:24:50 GMT

[[9, 12, 15], [24, 33, 42], [34, 47, 60]]
```

If you run into any problems, please file an issue!
