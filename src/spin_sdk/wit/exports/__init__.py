        This function is invoked with an incoming HTTP Request, and a resource
        `response-outparam` which provides the capability to reply with an HTTP
        Response. The response is sent by calling the `response-outparam.set`
        method, which allows execution to continue after the response has been
        sent. This enables both streaming to the response body, and performing other
        work.

        `response-outparam` before returning, or else the caller will respond
        with an error on its behalf.
